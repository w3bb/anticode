# the anticode of conduct

Modern code of conducts are focused on things that aren't important, such as 
policing thoughts, policing irrelevent behaviour, and fighting fire with fire.

The anticode of conduct is designed for what's important -- the code. This code
of conduct is designed to make people more productive, and leave politics at the
door. 

You can read the anticode in ANTICODE.md. All has been released into the
