the anticode of conduct
=======================

Modern codes of conduct are focused on things that aren't important,
such as policing thoughts, policing irrelevent behaviour, and fighting
fire with fire.

The anticode is designed for what's important. It's designed to make
people more productive, and focus on getting stuff done. It's simple,
easy to understand, accessible, and without ambiguity.

You can read the anticode in ANTICODE or ANTICODE.md. It is licensed
with the CC0 public domain license, which you can read in the COPYING
file.
