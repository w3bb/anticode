the anticode of conduct
=======================

Modern codes of conduct are focused on things that aren't important,
such as policing thoughts, policing irrelevent behaviour, and fighting
fire with fire.

The anticode is designed for what's important. It's designed to make
people more productive, and focus on getting stuff done. It's simple,
easy to understand, accessible, and without ambiguity.

You can read the anticode in ANTICODE or ANTICODE.md. All has been
released into the public domain, and if you're in a place that doesn't
have a public domain in a useful way, you may use this under the terms
of the LICENSE file.
